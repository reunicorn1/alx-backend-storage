# 0x01. NoSQL

NoSQL is a type of database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. It's often used for big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL databases are known for their ability to handle large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. They are built to allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema which makes them more flexible than relational databases.
