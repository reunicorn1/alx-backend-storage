# 0x00. MySQL advanced

Indexes: These are used to retrieve data from databases more quickly. They work similarly to an index in a book, providing a fast way to find specific information.
Procedures: These are stored routines that encapsulate complex queries or business logic. They can be called from within a SQL statement, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
Functions: Similar to procedures, but they return a single value. They can be used in SQL statements wherever an expression is used.
Views: These are virtual tables based on the result-set of an SQL statement. They allow you to encapsulate complex queries and present data in a simplified manner.
Triggers: These are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular table or view in a database. They can be used to enforce business rules or data integrity.
