# 0x02. Redis basic

Redis, which stands for Remote Dictionary Server, is an open-source, in-memory data structure store. It can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various types of data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes. Redis is known for its high performance, replication, and persistence features. It's widely used in real-time applications due to its ability to handle large amounts of data with minimal latency.
